# AccentClassifer
This is a Streamlit-based web app that detects the English accent (e.g., Indian, American, British) from a spoken .mp4 video. It uses Whisper for speech-to-text, SpeechBrain for speaker embeddings, and cosine similarity to classify the accent. The app also provides a confidence score and a short summary of the spoken content.
